# MyWeatherApp

The purpose of this project was to create a Weather dashboard which provides a current and 5 day forecast, using HTML, CSS, APIS,  Moment JS, Javascript and JQuery.

The User story is below:

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

The Acceptance criteria is below:

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
